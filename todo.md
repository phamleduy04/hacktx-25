- [ ] fix synthetic telemetry data (tire decay faster, use F1_Pit_call_Decision_Model.ipynb and test_model.py for example synthetic data format and realistic values)
- [ ] add passing on straights
- [ ] slow down on curves
- [ ] remove speed up above 100% speed
- [ ] slow down from tire wear
- [ ] add race incidents (everyone maintains position?)
- [ ] maybe add more gap time updates (5 per lap)
